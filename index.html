          <h3>Aquarius</h3>
          <p>
            Strengths: Progressive, original, independent, humanitarian
            <br /><br />
            Weaknesses: Runs from emotional expression, temperamental,
            uncompromising, aloof
            <br /><br />
            Aquarius likes: Fun with friends, helping others, fighting for
            causes, intellectual conversation, a good listener
            <br /><br />
            Aquarius dislikes: Limitations, broken promises, being lonely, dull
            or boring situations, people who disagree with them
          </p>
          <p>
            Aquarius-born are shy and quiet , but on the other hand they can be
            eccentric and energetic. However, in both cases, they are deep
            thinkers and highly intellectual people who love helping others.
            They are able to see without prejudice, on both sides, which makes
            them people who can easily solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them,
            Aquarius-born have a deep need to be some time alone and away from
            everything, in order to restore power. People born under the
            Aquarius sign, look at the world as a place full of possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aquarius is an air sign, and as such, uses his mind at every
            opportunity. If there is no mental stimulation, they are bored and
            lack a motivation to achieve the best result.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ruling planet of Aquarius, Uranus has a timid, abrupt and
            sometimes aggressive nature, but it also gives Aquarius visionary
            quality. They are capable of perceiving the future and they know
            exactly what they want to be doing five or ten years from now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uranus also gave them the power of quick and easy transformation, so
            they are known as thinkers, progressives and humanists. They feel
            good in a group or a community, so they constantly strive to be
            surrounded by other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest problem for Aquarius-born is the feeling that they are
            limited or constrained. Because of the desire for freedom and
            equality for all, they will always strive to ensure freedom of
            speech and movement. Aquarius-born have a reputation for being cold
            and insensitive persons, but this is just their defence mechanism
            against premature intimacy. They need to learn to trust others and
            express their emotions in a healthy way.
